After each question is introduced, table groups quickly discuss and align on their preferred response. Then, each table uses a special device to signal a response by raising or lowering a balloon, creating a striking visualization across the room as dozens of balloons lift in unison.<br /> <br />The facilitator then prompts participants from different tables to share their perspectives. Moving between table discussions and full-room shareouts creates a lively, layered conversation and an opportunity to explore multiple perspectives on key topics.',

The workshop results in a detailed set of learning-action plans and a rich set of outputs to drive the post-event agenda.",

Those collective commitment ideas are then shuffled, assessed, and ranked, with the top 5 to be shared aloud.<br /><br /> After these top collective commitments are identified, the participants are asked to make personal commitments to concrete actions that will support the group's high-priority collective commitments.

There are additional elements of physical play and collaboration to heighten the drama and the fun. <br /><br />Participants compete in teams to answer trivia questions designed with event organizers to test knowledge and highlight key content and themes. For each correct answer, a team adds a new block to their tower, and at the end of each round, teams with taller block towers are awarded more points. The twist? The taller the tower, the easier to topple. Commanding leads can vanish in an instant. This keeps the energy high, and the game close. Ties are broken with wild challenges using the blocks in unexpected – and humorous – ways.",

Working in small groups, participants are guided through a process designed to create a post-event roadmap of concrete experiments to launch, key milestones to hit, and/or objectives to target in a new learning agenda.<br /><br />The workshop begins with a set of themes or focus areas pre-identified and invites participant groups to address those themes with specific, relevant contributions (e.g., a 1-yr goal against a particular strategic objective). Each group then hands their work (captured on a Projectory RampUp block) off to another neighboring group, who now becomes the steward of the initial contribution and is responsible for generating a smart step or intermediate milestone in support of that objective. The RampUp block is then passed to another table group, who further contributes to the plan and process to create a series of linked actions focused on the original theme.<br /><br />Throughout, the facilitator invites groups to share their work, identifying common objectives, partners, and projects in the room as the session builds toward the physical construction of an installation pointing the way forward from the event.',
